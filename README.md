Make a landing page of a typical website as per following criteria:

Make the landing page UI as shown in the Figma link: https://www.figma.com/file/K9x6Hw8UrJD4EFAEQ5JnPb/M5-Test?node-id=0%3A1&t=s5BqPZSertXAHPvv-1

The header should be sticky and on clicking the links in the header, page should scroll to the specific component of the page.

The biggest heading should be animated, animate using keyframes of your choice- eg: fade in for 2 seconds.

On clicking the down arrow it should take the user to "Our Services" component.

"About Us" is a flex, in the mobile view make sure the flex direction is column.

"Our Services" has an overflow-x which allows the 3 services to be horizontally scrollable.

Add in a hover animation in the services - on hover of the service card make the background black and font white in 0.3 seconds.

Contact us is a form, on click of the submit make sure all fields are required.

Make the mobile view for the same, decrease the size of the fonts to make them fit into the screen accordingly.
